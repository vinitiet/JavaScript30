    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team)
    // // however what happens when we update that array?
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team)
    // now here is the problem!
    const team = players.slice();
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    const team3 = [...players];
    players[2] = 'Vini'
    console.log(players, team3);
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 } );
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    console.log(person, captain);
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
